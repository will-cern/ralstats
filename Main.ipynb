    "    2. Discovery p-values\n",

    "In your real work it is likely that you will utilise one of the many \"statistical toolkits\" that have been developed that will automate the calculation and visualization of these analyses for you. The objective of this session is to give you the **confidence that you understand what the toolkits *should* be doing** under the hood, and know how to interrogate the calculations they are making by **asking sensible questions** of those toolkits. This is an important skill because there are lots of ways in which these analyses can go wrong, and so **understanding what the calculations are doing is essential for enabling you to effectively debug problems.**\n",

    "## Hypothesis Testing: Exclusions and Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Exclusions and Discovery plots are just a way of presenting the results of a collection of Hypothesis Tests. A Hypothesis Test is really the process of calculating a p-value and seeing whether its less than or greater than a  critical value (0.05 in the case of 95% CL). The procedure for making these plots is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Define a `Hypothesis Space`, which involves deciding which parameters of the BSM model we want to scan over.\n",
    "      (elsewhere people call this a *parameter grid*):\n",
    "  2. Choose a `Test Statistic` to perform hypothesis tests with, the normal choice is:\n",
    "      * Exclusions: A one-sided *capped-above* Profile Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic ($q_\\mu$ or $\\tilde{q}_\\mu$)\n",
    "      * Discovery: A one-sided *capped-below* Profile Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic $q_0$\n",
    "  3. Choose a definition of `P Value` to use, there are three types:\n",
    "      * null p-value: The p-value under the null hypothesis (the hypothesis being tested)\n",
    "         * In exclusion tests the null hypothsesis is a particular s+b hypothesis, and null p-value is sometimes then called the CLs+b p-value.\n",
    "         * In discovery tests the null hypothesis is the bkg-only hypothesis, and the null p-value is sometimes called the $p_0$ p-value.\n",
    "      * alt p-value: The p-value under an alternative hypothesis (only relevant for exclusions), also calld the CLb p-value\n",
    "      * CLs p-value: The ratio of the above two p-values\n",
    "  4. Find the contour of `Hypothesis Points` in your `Hypothesis Space` where your chosen p-value equals the critical value (0.05 for a 95% confidence limit). This is usually done by selecting a grid of points in the space and computing the p-value for each (aka doing a hypothesis test), then interpolating between them to give you a contour. \n",
    "  5. `Expected` contours can also be computed by throwing toys from the expected hypothesis and computing the median p-value of these toys at each hypothesis point. The contour is drawn as before by interpolating these median p-values across the space. 1 sigma and 2 sigma \"bands\" can be computed by examining a different p-value than the median one, as we will discuss later.\n",
    "      * Note that the expected contour is often instead estimated by using the *Asimov Dataset* which corresponds to the expected data under the alternative hypothesis. This is not quite the same as using toys but usually gives a very similar result."
