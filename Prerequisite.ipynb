    "| Term | Description |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "| Variable | A fundamental type that has a value. They are often a continuous real-valued quantity but can also be a discrete (categorical) valued quantity. |\n",
    "| Observable | A variable that features in a dataset, representing a measurable quantity.  |\n",
    "| Global Observable | A special type of observable in a dataset that takes a value that is independent of the events, so it has the same value for every event and is defined even if the dataset has no events in it. |\n",
    "| Dataset | A collection of events that each have a set of values for the non-global observables of the dataset, and potentially also a weight. The dataset may also have a collection of global observable values. Think of the events like rows (entries) in a table and the non-global observables are the columns. The global observables are an extra set of values that sit alongside the table. Examples of non-globable observables are channel category and bin number. An example of a global observable is the integrated luminosity. |\n",
    "| PDF | A function of variables that, when evaluated, will return a probability density defined over a particular subset of the variables that is called the *normalization set* of the PDF. All the variables in the normalization set are considered to be observables. \n",
    "| Parameter | A variable of a function that is not an observable (i.e. for PDFs is a variable of the PDF that is not in the normalization set).\n",
    "| Likelihood | A function of parameters defined by the combination of a PDF with a Dataset (the observables of the dataset define the normalization set of the PDF). The value of the likelihood function = $p(g)\\prod_i p(o_{i})^{w_i}$ (where $g$ are the global observables, $o_i$ and $w_i$ are the observables and weight respectively of the ith entry of the dataset) and often the Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) is evaluated instead: -($\\Sigma_i w_i log(p(o_i)) +log(p(g)))$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In RooFit (as well as most other statistical analysis packages) the actual value of the likelihood function may not correspond to precisely the likelihood, but may instead include a multiplicative factor (additive in NLL) that depends only on data (i.e. does not depend on the parameters). This is acceptable because it is never the absolute value of likelihood that we are interested in, but we study likelihood ratios and delta-log-likelihood, so this factor cancels out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets can be binned or unbinned. When a dataset is binned this means all the events that fall in a given bin of some observable are combined into a single entry, with the observable value normally chosen to be the bin center, and the entry's weight equal to the sum (of weights) of the events in the bin. \n"
